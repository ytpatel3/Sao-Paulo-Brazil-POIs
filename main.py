# Yash Patel
# Project start date: 1-8-24
# Extract points of interest and their attributes (name, coordinates, address, category, hours of operation, reviews, number of reviews, and ratings) from log file and print in a structured XML file

# 1-8-24: Researched programming concepts required for project (regular expressions, XML processing, etc.)
# 1-13-24: Wrote preliminary python code which extracts points of interest from log file using regular expression patterns
# 1-17-24: Wrote code to print extracted points of interest to XML file
# 1-20-24: Made XML file more structured using .toprettyxml() from minidom
# 1-22-24: Regular expression patterns were incorrect but fixed name_pattern this day
# 2-10-24: Rewrote regular expression patterns for coordinates and number of reviews
# 2-15-24: Rewrote regex pattern for name attribute (fixed it)
